# Network Basics - Web Application Fundamentals

Hey there! Welcome to the **Web Application Basics** guide. Whether you’re new or brushing up your skills, this will help you understand how websites and apps work behind the scenes.

---

## What You'll Learn
- What is a web app and how it works on your browser.
- How URLs help you find stuff online.
- How browsers and servers talk using HTTP.
- What those numbers and messages you see mean (status codes).
- Why security headers are important to keep things safe.

---

## Imagine a Web App Like a Planet
- **Front End:** What you see and click (HTML, CSS, JS).
- **Back End:** The hidden stuff that makes it all work (databases, servers).
- **WAF:** Like a planet’s shield that protects the app from bad guys.

## URL — The Web Address
A URL is like a map telling your browser where to go.

- **Scheme:** HTTP or HTTPS (secure!).
- **Domain:** The website name.
- **Path:** Which page or file you want.
- **Query:** Extra info like search words.
- **Fragment:** Jump to a section on the page.

---

## How HTTP Works
Your browser sends:

- **Requests:** “Hey server, send me this page!”
- **Responses:** “Here you go! Status: OK or Not Found.”

### Request Methods
- **GET:** Just asking for info.
- **POST:** Sending info (like a form).
- **PUT, DELETE:** Changing or removing stuff.
- Watch out! Always check who’s allowed to do what.

## Understanding Responses
Servers reply with:

- A **status code** telling if things worked (200), moved (301), missing (404), or broke (500).
- Some **headers** with info about the response.
- The **body** with the content you wanted.

---

## Keep It Safe — Security Headers
Headers like:

- **CSP:** Controls what can load on the page.
- **HSTS:** Makes sure connections are always secure.
- **X-Content-Type-Options:** Stops browsers guessing file types.
- **Referrer-Policy:** Controls what info is shared when you click links.

---

## Try It Out!
- Make a GET request to `/api/users` — find the hidden flag!
- Update user data with POST.
- Delete a user with DELETE.

---

## That’s It!
Now you know the basics behind web apps and how they stay safe.
