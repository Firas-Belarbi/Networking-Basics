# Networking Basics Overview

## What is Networking?
Networking is the communication system that allows devices (computers, phones, servers) to exchange information.

## Key Concepts
- **IP Address** – The address of a device in a network.
- **MAC Address** – Unique identifier of a network card.
- **Router** – Connects networks and sends packets to their destination.
- **Switch** – Connects devices inside the same LAN.
- **Access Point** – Provides wireless connection (WiFi).
- **DNS** – Translates domain names (google.com) to IP addresses.
- **DHCP** – Automatically gives IP addresses to devices.

## Networking Layers
- **Layer 7 – Application** (HTTP, DNS)
- **Layer 4 – Transport** (TCP, UDP)
- **Layer 3 – Network** (IP)
- **Layer 2 – Data Link** (MAC)
- **Layer 1 – Physical** (Cables, signals)

## Protocols You Should Know
- **TCP** – Reliable connection, used for web, email, SSH.
- **UDP** – Faster, no verification, used for games/streaming.
- **HTTP** – Communication between browser and website.
- **HTTPS** – Secure HTTP with TLS encryption.
